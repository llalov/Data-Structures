Balanced binary search trees:<br/>
----<b>B-Trees:</b><br/>
--------Generalization of the concept of ordered binary search trees.<br/>
--------The keys in each node are ordered increasingly<br/>
--------All keys in a child node have values between their left and right parent keys<br/>
--------The count of nodes from the root to any null node is the same<br/>
----<b>Red-black Trees:</b> (fast insertion/deletion)<br/>
--------binary search tree with red and black nodes. <br/>
--------Not perfectly balanced but has height of O(log(n)). Used in C# and Java: ( https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~gallevisualization/RedBlack.html )<br/>
--------All leaves are black<br/>
--------The root is black<br/>
--------No node has two red links connected to it<br/>
--------Every path from a given node to its descendant leaf nodes contains the same number of black nodes<br/>
--------Red links lean left<br/>
