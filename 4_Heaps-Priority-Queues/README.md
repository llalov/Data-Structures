Priority Queues / Heaps
	Priority Queue: (fast max/min element)
		an abstract data type which is like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated 
		with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. 
		If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.
	Heap/Binary Heap: 
		Heaps: Tree based data structure, sorted in an array, used to implement priority queues. Hold heap property: the key stored in each node is
			either greater than or equal to (=) or less than or equal to (=) the keys in the node's children.
		Binary Heaps: represent a Binary Tree. Every level except the last one is completely filled. Last is filled from left to right.
