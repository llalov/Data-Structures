------------BFS(Breadth-First Search): node -> neighbours -> neighbours of neighbours, etc. <br/>
--------Binary search tree: Each node has at most 2 children (left and right).<br/>
------------Traversing:<br/>
----------------Pre-Order: Root, Left, Right<br/>
----------------In-Order: Left, Root, Right<br/>
